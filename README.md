Stopwatch Web App is a lightweight and interactive stopwatch built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a clean and responsive UI with essential stopwatch functionalities:  Start/Pause: Begin or halt the timer.  Reset: Clear the current timing and start over.  Lap: Record intermediate time intervals without stopping the main timer.
